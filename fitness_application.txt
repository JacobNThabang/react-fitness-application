Instructions:

You are required to create a React application that helps users track their fitness progress.

The application should include the following functionality:
a. Display a list of exercises, each with an image, exercise name, and a button to add the exercise to a workout log.
b. Display a workout log that shows the list of exercises that have been added to the log, along with the total time spent on each exercise and the total calories burned.
c. Allow the user to remove exercises from the workout log.
d. Allow the user to change the time spent on exercises in the workout log.
e. Allow the user to reset the workout log.

The application should save/fetch data to/from local storage and display it in the application. An example of this would be:
[
   {
      "id":1,
      "name":"Push-ups",
      "image":"https://www.example.com/images/push-ups.jpg",
      "calories_per_minute": 6
   },
   {
      "id":2,
      "name":"Sit-ups",
      "image":"https://www.example.com/images/sit-ups.jpg",
      "calories_per_minute":5
   }
…
]
The workout log section will include more/different fields, but we’ll leave this open for you. 

You are free to use any CSS framework or libraries that you are familiar with, or you can implement the styles yourself. We usually recommend Tailwind, Material UI or Bootstrap.
The application should be implemented using functional components and hooks.
You should include unit tests for at least one of your components.
You can use any libraries or tools that you think are appropriate.

Task:
1. Create a new React application using `create-react-app`.
2. Implement the application according to the instructions above.
3. Commit your changes to a new GitHub repository and send us the link.
4. Write a brief README that explains how to run the application locally and how to run the tests.
